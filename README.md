# OSS-Assignment

Here we use the basic shell scripting to implement a grading system to calculate the overall grade and its subsequent letter grade. Indeed, shell is a program which prompts the user and directs the operating system to do what the user wants. Shell scripts has the ability to pass variables or parameters and behave differently. In this grading system, scripts are used that using that script or function it can refer to the variables. The parameters are used with a $ prefix symbol in order to reference them as with other shell variables. 

The script will run on Linux systems with bash as shell. First of all the user is required to change their current working directory to root directory then the user should the read and write permission " chmod 777 gradingSystem.sh or chmod 755 gradingSystem.sh ". This will enable the user to run the script and will write the input as well as the grades in number and alphabet.

There are some constraints used which the program will only accept the correct data type. The student name should be only string and incase the numbers are entered then the system will not accept rather will reject and will prompt the user to use a proper name as well as for the marks. The marks only accepts integer and or float values.
